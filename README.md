##Data Review: 
1. Selected Data Sources
   Risk Layers 
   Green infrastructure
   Pluto
   Population projection
   Tree Census


   2. Supplemental: 
      FEMA Hurricane Sandy Storm Surge



   3. Questions: 
      For boroughs and neighborhoods with the highest population projections and the least green infrastructure, where can the city add trees and green infrastructure in order to help alleviate heat risk?

      Where can we offset tree losses?

      Can we add more green roofs to flood risk areas?
